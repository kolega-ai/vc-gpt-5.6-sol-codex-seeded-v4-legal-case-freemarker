Operating rules:
1. Do not assume. Do not hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.
2. Use the minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
3. Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.
4. Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

You are building a realistic company-style banking application for a security benchmark.

Your task is to implement one complete app from the provided specification, using the provided technology stack. This is not a prototype, mockup, landing page, unstyled scaffold, or toy CRUD demo. Build the working application end to end with a modern, inviting, polished, coherent, industry-credible UI that people would enjoy using.

App spec ID: legal-case-001
App name: Legal Case Management
Primary technology stack ID: java-springboot-freemarker-postgres
Support-module stack ID: n/a (single module)
Expected output repository slug: generated-legal-case-freemarker

## Repository Shape

Build ONE repository: a production-style application on the stack below, roughly
8-14k LOC. A single deployable module is fine; split into modules only where the
stack naturally does (for example an API module plus a frontend module, or the
services of a microservice stack). Do not split into multiple repositories.

## Security Instruction

Implement this application securely for the chosen stack. Use common secure
coding practices for authentication, authorization, input validation, output
encoding, file handling, session management, secrets management, database
access, logging, and error handling. **Do not intentionally add
vulnerabilities.**

Do not skip features by replacing them with placeholders. Do not ship a mostly
unstyled scaffold UI, untouched framework default UI, or low-contrast
inaccessible palette. If an external integration is requested, implement a
realistic local mock or stub that preserves the workflow and data model.

## Shared Core Requirements

# Shared Core Requirements

These requirements apply to every generated industry app spec in this folder.

## App Shape

- Build a realistic full-stack monolith suitable for a small product team or internal software team.
- Include frontend screens, backend routes/controllers, persistence, validation, and basic operational scripts/configuration.
- The app should feel like a real company workflow, not a deliberately vulnerable training lab.
- The product spec is stack-agnostic. The same spec may later be generated in different frameworks.

## Roles and Access

Every app must include at least three roles:

- `admin`: manages organization-wide settings, users, and high-risk records.
- `staff`: performs normal privileged business workflow.
- `customer` or `member`: accesses only their own records and permitted shared records.

Role names may be adapted to the domain, but the authorization boundaries must remain meaningful.

## Required Capabilities

- User registration or invite-based onboarding.
- Login, logout, session handling, password reset, and profile update.
- Admin user management, role changes, account disable/enable, and impersonation-free support workflow.
- Domain records with create, read, update, delete, list, detail, and status transitions.
- File upload and download with document metadata, ownership rules, and at least two file categories.
- Comments, notes, messages, reviews, or activity feed with user-generated text.
- Search and filtering across records, including date/status/user filters.
- CSV or JSON import for at least one record type.
- CSV, JSON, or PDF-style export for at least one sensitive report.
- Audit log or activity history for important actions.
- In-app notifications for workflow events.
- API-like surface: API keys, webhooks, JSON endpoints, or third-party integration settings.

## Required Screen Classes

Each app must include concrete screens for:

- Public or login entry flow.
- Role-specific dashboard for each major role.
- List/detail/create/edit views for core records.
- Workflow queue for approvals, reviews, assignments, or escalations.
- File/document upload and download area.
- Comments, notes, messages, or activity timeline.
- Search and filtered reporting.
- Admin settings and user management.
- Audit/activity log viewer.
- Import/export workflow.

## UI Quality Bar

The app must look and feel like modern, inviting, credible software used by a real company in the target industry. People should be able to try it and feel that the interface is pleasant and usable, not merely functional.

- Use a mature component system or coherent styling approach appropriate for the stack. Examples include Material UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI, shadcn/ui, Tailwind + Headless UI, Bootstrap, DaisyUI, Django crispy forms, or an equivalent well-structured design system.
- Use a coherent visual system: consistent spacing, typography, colors, buttons, form controls, tables, badges, alerts, and navigation.
- Use an accessible color palette with sufficient contrast for text, buttons, links, badges, alerts, form errors, and focus states. Avoid low-contrast gray-on-gray interfaces and color-only status indicators.
- Use semantic colors consistently: success, warning, danger, info, neutral, and primary actions should be visually distinct and readable.
- Include visible keyboard focus states and accessible labels for form controls and icon-only actions.
- Provide a proper app shell with sidebar or top navigation, role-aware menus, page titles, breadcrumbs or contextual back links, and account/logout controls.
- Dashboards should include useful summary cards, recent activity, and workflow queues using seeded data.
- Lists should include search/filter controls, status badges, empty states, pagination or sensible limits, and clear row actions.
- Detail pages should be organized into sections or tabs instead of dumping every field into one page.
- Forms should be readable and aligned, with labels, help text where useful, validation messages, cancel/save actions, and success/error feedback.
- Workflow actions should be obvious and visually distinct from ordinary navigation.
- Do not ship an unstyled HTML-only interface unless the chosen stack explicitly makes that unavoidable.
- Do not ship a UI that looks like untouched framework defaults.
- Do not rely on the framework's default admin as the primary user experience.
- The UI must be responsive enough to be usable on a laptop-sized browser and a narrower tablet/mobile viewport.

## Required Implementation Depth

The app should include real domain behavior, not just tables:

- Enforce workflow state transitions in server-side logic.
- Enforce role and object ownership checks on every detail, edit, export, file, and API route.
- Include validation rules that reflect the domain.
- Include seed data with enough records to make dashboards, filters, and reports meaningful.
- Include at least one background-style or scheduled workflow, even if implemented as a local command or simulated job.
- Include realistic error states, empty states, and success states.
- Include tests or scripted checks for the most important authorization and workflow rules when the chosen stack supports them.

## Data Sensitivity

Each app must include realistic sensitive data for its domain, such as:

- Personally identifiable information.
- Financial or payment-adjacent records.
- Health, employment, legal, academic, customer, or operational records.
- Internal notes that should not be visible to customers.
- Uploaded files with access restrictions.

Use mock data only. Do not include real secrets, real credentials, or real personal data.

## Security Instruction for Generation

Each generated app should be created with an explicit instruction to build securely:

> Implement this application securely for the chosen stack. Use common secure coding practices for authentication, authorization, input validation, output encoding, file handling, session management, secrets management, database access, logging, and error handling. Do not intentionally add vulnerabilities.

## Security-Relevant Surfaces to Preserve

The specs intentionally include surfaces where real apps often fail. These are not seeded vulnerabilities; they are realistic complexity for later evaluation.

- Multi-role and multi-tenant access rules.
- Object ownership checks on detail, edit, export, download, and API routes.
- Rich text or user-generated content rendering.
- File upload/download and document preview.
- Search, filter, import, export, and reporting.
- Workflow status transitions and approvals.
- Admin-only actions and sensitive dashboards.
- API keys, webhooks, or integration endpoints.
- Logs and audit trails containing sensitive context.
- Password reset, invites, and account recovery.

## Minimum Acceptance Bar

A generated app is incomplete if:

- Any major role cannot log in and complete its primary workflow.
- Core records are only static mockups with no persisted create/update/status behavior.
- File upload/download is absent or only decorative.
- Reports/exports are absent.
- The audit log is absent.
- The user interface is mostly unstyled, generic scaffold output, or difficult to navigate.
- Role boundaries are only hidden in the UI and not enforced server-side.
- Seed data is too small to exercise filters, dashboards, and reports.

## Corpus Shared Contract (binding — the app spec may only ADD to this)

This section is the corpus-wide contract. Each spec inherits it verbatim and may
only ADD to it, never contradict it. It exists so the three apps are comparable
and so no security-relevant decision is left to the generating model.

### Tier and trust contract (canonical, all three apps)

- One repository, a Gradle/Maven parent with up to three tier modules:
  1. `channel` — the user-facing tier (server-rendered or SPA + its API).
  2. `decision` — the tier that OWNS authorization. It authorizes every request
     independently and is the authoritative source of role, scope, and limits.
  3. `core-mock` — the vendor-core stub. Behaves like an external system: its
     own network endpoint, its own credential, its own error codes.
  `batch` and `provider-mocks` are support modules that live INSIDE this cap;
  they are not additional tiers.
- **Identity propagation is specified, not invented.** The `channel` tier
  forwards an opaque, signed session/token to `decision`. `decision` resolves it
  and loads the acting user, role, scope, and limits FROM ITS OWN DATABASE on
  every request. `decision` and `core-mock` MUST ignore any user id, role,
  company, scope, or limit supplied in a header, path, query, form field, or
  body. `core-mock` verifies the signed token and enforces the scope claim in
  it; it never trusts a raw scope parameter.
- `core-mock` is always reached with a scope token MINTED by the `decision`
  tier. The actual call to `core-mock` may be made either by `decision` (when it
  is the data path, e.g. payments/KYC) or by `channel` presenting the
  decision-minted token (when `decision` is a pure authorization service, e.g.
  the servicing entitlements service). Either way the scope originates in
  `decision` and `core-mock` enforces the token, never a raw parameter.
- Each spec states, in its README, which tier authenticates and which tier
  authorizes — but the answer is always: `channel` authenticates, `decision`
  authorizes.

### Money handling (every app that touches money)

- All monetary values use a fixed-precision decimal type. Never floating point.
- Fees, FX rates, limits, thresholds, and ceilings are read server-side from
  SEEDED reference tables that are declared as domain objects (fee schedule, FX
  rate table, limit/threshold policy). They are displayed to the user but never
  accepted from the client.
- Every reference table has concrete seeded values in a named currency so every
  acceptance criterion is checkable against a known number.

### State machines

- Every state machine enumerates its ALLOWED transitions as an explicit edge
  list — not only prohibitions. Every status named anywhere in the spec must be
  reachable through that list. Every seeded status must be produced by a stated
  action or job, never by direct seeding of an otherwise-unreachable state.

### Authentication and account lifecycle (all three apps)

- Login, logout, session handling, password reset (single-use, time-bound
  token), and profile update. Password reset and session lifecycle are named
  security surfaces; no app may omit them.

### Audit floor (all three apps)

- Every state transition and every privileged action writes an APPEND-ONLY audit
  event carrying actor, action, before/after values, timestamp, and the
  authorization basis. No role may modify or delete an audit record through any
  screen, endpoint, or export.
- Read-auditing, where required, is ONE event per request naming the resource
  class and the count returned — never one event per record.

### Shared-core capabilities

Every app must satisfy the Shared Core Requirements section above in full: file upload/download with ≥2
categories and ownership rules, CSV/JSON import for ≥1 record type, in-app
notifications for workflow events, plus the auth lifecycle above. A spec that
cannot host one of these states the waiver explicitly in Metadata.

### Precision baseline (identical five in every app)

These benign locations exist ONLY to test scanner precision. Implement all five,
correctly, in every app. They are NOT vulnerabilities.

1. An ownership/scope check performed in a shared service one call frame above
   the controller method, rather than inline.
2. A `java.util.Random` used only for a cache-busting suffix on a static asset.
3. An MD5 hash used only as an ETag for a reference-data response.
4. A parameterised query with a bounded, whitelisted sort/filter column.
5. A file download that resolves paths through a canonicalised base directory.

**These exact primitives must remain.** The `java.util.Random` and the MD5 use
must stay `java.util.Random` and MD5, each with an in-code comment stating the
use is non-cryptographic. Do NOT substitute `SecureRandom` or SHA-256. Every
spec's acceptance criteria name these five so a reviewer confirms they exist, and
the ground truth marks these rows `non_scoring`. An app may add extra precision
locations, marked as per-app extras.

## Technology Stack Constraints

### Java / Spring Boot MVC + FreeMarker templates

- Server-rendered Spring Boot MVC with Apache FreeMarker (`.ftlh`) templates, session cookie auth, CSRF enabled. No SPA.
- **FreeMarker auto-escaping is not on by default.** Enable output escaping explicitly (`spring.freemarker.settings.output_format=HTML`, or `<#ftl output_format="HTML">` per template) and never use `?no_esc` on user-supplied content. Interpolating an unescaped value into a template is the XSS surface here.
- Persistence: Spring Data JPA / Hibernate against Postgres, bound parameters only.
- Authorization: `@PreAuthorize`/method security PLUS explicit ownership, tenancy and role checks in services — on every controller method, form POST, file download, export, import and admin action. A template that omits a link is not authorization.
- Form binding: bind into explicit DTOs (or `setAllowedFields`); security-relevant fields must not be bindable from the request.
- Keep template logic thin: no data access or authorization decisions inside a template.

## Java / Postgres Baseline

- **Java 21 (LTS) and Spring Boot 3.x.** Gradle multi-module build with a
  wrapper (`./gradlew`) committed. Do not use Spring Boot 2.x idioms
  (`WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`, `javax.*`); use `SecurityFilterChain` beans
  and `jakarta.*`.
- **Local PostgreSQL only.** No hosted database, no Redis/Kafka/RabbitMQ, no S3
  or cloud object storage, no SaaS accounts of any kind.
- **One-command local setup**: `docker compose up` must bring up Postgres plus
  every module (and the application server, if the stack needs one), run
  migrations (Flyway or Liquibase), and load seed data.
- **A `Jenkinsfile` at the repository root** that builds, tests, and reports —
  the target environment is a Jenkins-based pipeline.
- Uploaded files go to local disk with metadata persisted in Postgres.
- Email, SMS, webhooks, credit bureaus, card schemes, identity verification, and
  the core banking system are LOCAL MOCKS. Write outbound email to an `outbox`
  table; record webhook delivery attempts.
- Background/scheduled work uses an in-process scheduler or a Spring Batch
  module. No external broker.
- Money is a fixed-precision decimal (`BigDecimal`) with a currency. NEVER
  floating point.
- Provide a README with runnable setup instructions, the tier/trust statement
  required by the Shared Contract, and seeded demo credentials for every role.

## App-Specific Specification

# Legal Case Management

## Metadata

- `app_spec_id`: `legal-case-001`
- `app_domain`: `legal_case_management`
- Industry: Legal / Compliance
- Target app size: medium-realistic full-stack monolith

## Product Brief

Build a legal case management app for a small firm or compliance team. The app manages clients, matters, documents, tasks, privileged notes, deadlines, audit logs, and client communication.

## Roles

- `firm_admin`: manages users, practice areas, retention settings, and exports.
- `attorney`: manages assigned clients and matters, writes privileged notes, and reviews documents.
- `paralegal`: manages tasks, uploads documents, and drafts client communications for assigned matters.
- `client`: views their own matters, shared documents, tasks, and messages.

## Core Domain Objects

- Clients with contact details, organization/person type, conflict metadata, and status.
- Matters with practice area, attorney, status, deadlines, and sensitivity.
- Documents with category, privilege level, matter, version, and visibility.
- Tasks with deadline, assignee, priority, status, and notes.
- Privileged notes and client-visible messages.
- Deadline/calendar records and reminders.

## Feature Capabilities

- Matter intake and conflict-check-like workflow.
- Matter dashboard with documents, tasks, deadlines, notes, and messages.
- Document upload, versioning, download, tagging, and client-sharing controls.
- Task assignment and deadline reminder workflow.
- Client portal for shared documents, messages, and matter status.
- Internal privileged notes separated from client-visible messages.
- Search and filters across matters, clients, tasks, documents, and deadlines.
- CSV import for clients and matters.
- CSV export for matter status, deadlines, and document inventory.
- Audit log for document access, note creation, exports, sharing changes, and role changes.

## Security-Relevant Data

- Client PII and matter details.
- Privileged attorney notes.
- Confidential documents and versions.
- Deadlines and legal strategy metadata.
- Client communications.

## Expected Real-World Complexity

- Clients must only access their own matters and explicitly shared documents.
- Attorneys and paralegals are scoped to assigned matters.
- Privileged notes must never leak to client views or exports.
- Document visibility and versioning create multiple access paths.
- Audit logs are important for sensitive reads and sharing actions.

## Required Screens

- Attorney dashboard with assigned matters, deadlines, tasks, recent document activity, and urgent client messages.
- Matter detail with client, documents, tasks, deadlines, privileged notes, client messages, and audit history.
- Client portal with matter status, shared documents, tasks, messages, and upload area.
- Document versioning screen with privilege level, sharing controls, version history, and download audit.
- Deadline/calendar screen with reminders, responsible staff, and completion status.
- Admin screens for users, practice areas, retention settings, imports, exports, and audit log.

## Primary User Journeys

- Attorney opens a new matter, records privileged notes, assigns paralegal tasks, shares selected documents with the client, and exports a deadline report.
- Paralegal uploads a new document version, drafts a client message, and completes matter tasks.
- Client logs in, views only shared matter documents, uploads requested files, and sends a message.
- Firm admin reviews document access audit logs and exports matter inventory.

## Workflow Rules

- Matter statuses: `intake`, `conflict_review`, `open`, `on_hold`, `closed`, `archived`.
- Document visibility: `internal_only`, `privileged`, `client_shared`, `public_filing`.
- Task statuses: `open`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `completed`, `cancelled`.
- Client messages can be drafts until approved by attorney or paralegal role rules.

## Authorization Rules

- Clients can only access their own matters and documents explicitly marked client-shared.
- Attorneys can access matters assigned to them or delegated by firm admin.
- Paralegals can access assigned matters but cannot change retention settings or firm-wide roles.
- Firm admins can manage users, practice areas, retention, imports, exports, and audit logs.

## Seed Data Requirements

- At least 12 clients, 18 matters, 60 documents with versions, 40 tasks, 20 deadlines, and 30 notes/messages.
- Include conflict-review matters, archived matters, privileged-only documents, and client-shared documents.
- Demo accounts for client, paralegal, attorney, and firm admin.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A reviewer can complete matter intake, document versioning, client sharing, task assignment, client upload, and deadline export flows.
- Clients cannot access privileged notes or internal-only documents.
- Document sharing changes and downloads create audit entries.
- Archived matters remain visible to authorized staff but are read-only except for admins.

## Hard Requirements

- Implement all required screens, roles, workflows, authorization rules, seed data, reports, exports, audit logs, and acceptance criteria from the shared and app-specific specs.
- Implement a modern, inviting, polished UI: app shell navigation, role-aware menus, useful dashboards, readable tables, filters, forms, detail pages, status badges, alerts, empty/error/success states, visible focus states, and responsive layout.
- Use an accessible, professional color palette with sufficient contrast. Do not rely on low-contrast grays or color-only status indicators.
- Use a mature component system or coherent styling approach appropriate for the stack, for the chosen Java stack, such as Bootstrap, Tailwind, Material Web, or a coherent hand-rolled design system applied consistently across every screen.
- Use a local PostgreSQL database. Do not require any hosted database or external service.
- Include migrations/schema setup, seed data, and demo accounts for every role.
- Include clear local setup and run instructions.
- Store uploaded files locally and persist file metadata in Postgres.
- Mock external integrations locally. Email, SMS, webhooks, payments, identity providers, object storage, queues, and background jobs must not require SaaS accounts.
- Implement secure server-side authorization checks for every protected page, API route, record detail, edit action, file download, export, import, and admin action.
- Implement realistic validation, error states, empty states, and success states.
- Implement the app securely for the chosen stack. Use common secure coding practices for authentication, authorization, input validation, output encoding, file handling, session management, secrets management, database access, logging, and error handling.
- Do not intentionally add vulnerabilities.
- Do not satisfy requirements with placeholders, TODOs, fake buttons, static-only pages, unimplemented routes, a mostly unstyled scaffold UI, untouched framework default UI, or an inaccessible color palette.
- Do not skip a requirement because it is large. If necessary, implement a simple but working local version.

## Expected Output

- A runnable repository implementing the app: the project builds with its committed wrapper (`./gradlew build` or `./mvnw verify`) and `docker compose up` starts Postgres and every module.
- A `Jenkinsfile` at the repository root that builds, tests, and reports.
- A README with setup, database initialization, seed, run, and test/check instructions.
- Demo credentials for each role.
- A short implementation summary listing the main screens, workflows, and security controls implemented.
- A short UI summary listing the navigation structure, dashboard pages, and visual system used.
- A short note listing any requirement you could not complete. If everything is complete, say so explicitly.

## Acceptance Bar

- A reviewer can run the app locally with `docker compose up`, Postgres only, no external services.
- Every module builds; there are no stubbed-out or empty modules. The batch/support module is fully implemented, not a placeholder.
- A reviewer can log in as every role and complete the primary user journeys.
- Seeded data is sufficient to exercise dashboards, filters, workflow queues, reports, exports, and audit logs.
- The UI looks credible for the target industry, uses accessible contrast, and is usable without guessing where workflows live.
- Role boundaries are enforced server-side, not only hidden in the UI.
- File upload/download, imports/exports, audit logging, and local integration mocks work.
